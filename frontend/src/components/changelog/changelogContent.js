/**
 * Changelog — hardcoded "What's New" content (libraryContent.js philosophy).
 *
 * INVARIANT: The first entry's `version` IS the app version — bump it for
 * every player-facing release; never edit an entry's content without
 * bumping its version (the What's New badge keys off version equality).
 * Entries are ordered NEWEST FIRST.
 *
 * Entry shape:
 * {
 *   version: string,      // "1.0" MAJOR.MINOR
 *   date: string,         // "YYYY-MM-DD"
 *   major: boolean,       // true -> auto-open once for returning players
 *   highlights: string[], // 3-5 short lines — new features live here
 *   sections: { changed: string[], fixed: string[], balance: string[] } // render only non-empty; balance lines include a short "why"
 * }
